# Learning Golang by building a Key-Value Store

## Goals

- Phase #1: Build a command-line key-value store (with persistence)
- Phase #2: Add HTTP interface to KV Store
- Phase #3: Implement B-Tree or LSM Tree

Other things to consider: Bloom filters,etc
Will add other phases as I finish the current ones.

## Running program

Note: You need to have Golang setup before hand

```bash
go run main.go
```
